# diredly - the micro static site generator

diredly is a micro static site generator.

## Why ?

There are plenty of static site generators out there to suit the
tastes of everyone. Except, I could not find one that suited mine.

I found in my work that sites are needed for different
reasons. Sometimes it's for wire-frames that are interactive instead
of static photoshop mocks. Sometimes it's 10 pages for a restaurant
with consistent navigation and you are authoring most of the HTML
rather than generating it. Other times it may be static pages and
pages authored in something like Markdown with some meta data, and you
need a page to list them in date descending order. And of course
sometimes it's a full blown single page application with JSON end
points and such.

I'm too lazy to learn how other site generators do it. :)
